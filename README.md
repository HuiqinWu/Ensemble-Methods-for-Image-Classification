# Ensemble-Methods-for-Image-Classification
In this project, We implemented several ensemble methods (including bagging, AdaBoost, SAMME, stacking, snapshot ensemble) for a normal CNN model and Residual Neural Network. The detailed implementation and discussion is in the [report](https://github.com/zhangyaqi1989/Ensemble-Methods-for-Image-Classification/blob/master/report.pdf).
